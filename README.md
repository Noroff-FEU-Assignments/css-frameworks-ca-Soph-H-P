# CSS Frameworks Course Assignment

## Completed design using React Bootstrap and SCSS

Where appropriate I customised the Bootstrap variables in a custom scss file. I then created partials to add more specific styles.

I created page components that could be linked to using react router and then added components within these pages, to keep the code logically organised.


## Brief

From the supplied design, use Bootstrap or React Bootstrap to create a responsive website.

## Level 1 Process

- You may use React or regular HTML, JavaScript and Sass.
- You may use Bootstrap or React Bootstrap.
- Use one of Sass, CSS Modules or Styled Components to style the project.
- You can use Font Awesome or another icon library for the icons.
- The fonts in the design are Google fonts.

## Level 2 Process

- If you use Sass, use BEM to create your class names.

## Resources

The design and additional files can be found in this repo.

## Marking Criteria

- The site should match the design as closely as possible and should be responsive across all device sizes.
- If your project uses Sass, the files should be appropriately named and arranged in partials.
- If your project uses React, your components should be appropriately named and arranged.

## Submission

- When you accepted this submission, a repository was created for you. Use this repository for your code and submit a link to this repo when you deliver.
- Remember to EXCLUDE the node_modules folder if you use React or any npm packages

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
